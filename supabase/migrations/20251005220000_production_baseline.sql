-- Production Baseline Migration
-- This migration represents the current state of the production database
-- after applying the complete.sql schema via Supabase SQL editor

-- Note: This is a baseline migration that represents the current production state
-- All future migrations will be applied on top of this baseline

-- The actual schema is already in production, so this migration is empty
-- but it serves as a checkpoint for the migration system

-- Future migrations should be created with:
-- npx supabase migration new <migration_name>
